# v0.8.0 (2017-01-20)

- BREAKING CHANGE: Custom description and display function expressions now receive the variant fields as separate parameters instead of in a single tuple.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Added `Sync` bound on the `ResultExt` trait and `ChainedError::extract_backtrace` function for compatibility with `error-chain` v0.8.0
- Added new `cause = ...` item to variant attribute to override the default value returned by `::std::error::Error::cause()`

# v0.7.2 (2016-12-28)

- Removed `#[doc(hidden)]` on members of `Error` struct.
- Added new methods to `ChainedError` impl for compatibility with `error-chain` v0.7.2

# v0.7.1 (2016-12-23)

- Fixed error message for malformed chainable links.

# v0.7.0 (2016-12-05)

- BREAKING CHANGE: The types generated by this proc macro now use some items from the `error-chain`crate. Thus your crate will now require a dependency on the `error-chain` in addition to this `derive-error-chain` crate.
- For the same reason, the backtrace functionality uses `error-chain`'s re-exported `backtrace` crate, so your crate no longer needs to depend on the `backtrace` crate.
- BREAKING CHANGE: For compatibility with the new `ErrorKind` enum generated by `error-chain`, the chainable link variants of an `ErrorKind` now contain only the chainable error kind object and not the chainable error itself. Thus chainable link variants have a breaking change in syntax, from `Foo(SomeError, SomeErrorKind)` to `#[error_chain(link = "SomeError")] Foo(SomeErrorKind)`
- The version number of this crate will now follow `error-chain`. This implies that version 0.7 of `derive-error-chain` is expected to be similar in functionality to version 0.7 of `error-chain`, and so on.

# v0.1.2 (2016-11-18)

- BREAKING CHANGE: Due to new proc_macro semantics, every `ErrorKind` enum now needs a special `Msg(String)` member.
- Added `backtrace = ...` item to top-level `#[error_chain]` attribute to allow overriding the backtrace type or disabling backtrace functionality completely.

# v0.1.1 (2016-11-12)

- Fixed default name for `ChainErr` trait to be `ChainErr`, and added `chain_err = "Foo"` item to top-level `#[error_chain]` attribute to override the name.

# v0.1.0 (2016-11-12)

First release.
